            Apple.com uses the F design to create a sense of order and guide the
            viewer's attention through the content. The important content is
            placed at the top of the page, and headings and subheadings are
            displayed using bold and contrasting typography. Different sections
            of the page are visually separated using white space and visual
            breaks, making it easier for viewers to find the information they
            need. Images and other visual elements are also used to guide the
            viewer's eye. Following these guidelines, Apple.com has created a
            clear and effective visual hierarchy that helps viewers stay engaged
            with the content.

            Visual hierarchy is a crucial concept in design that involves
            organizing visual elements in a way that creates a sense of order
            and guides the viewer's attention through the content. This can be
            achieved by using various techniques, such as placing important
            content at the top of the page, using bold and contrasting
            typography for headings and subheadings, creating clear visual
            separation between different sections using white space and visual
            breaks, and using images and other visual elements to guide the
            viewer's eye. A good example of effective visual hierarchy can be
            seen in the design of Dropbox's website, where important information
            is placed prominently at the top of the page, clear headings and
            subheadings are used to organize content, and visual elements such
            as icons and images are used to break up text and guide the viewer's
            eye. By utilizing these techniques, designers can create a clear and
            effective visual hierarchy that helps viewers find the information
            they need and stay engaged with the content.

          <p>
            PARC is a set of design principles that stand for Proximity,
            Alignment, Repetition, and Contrast. These principles can help
            designers create efficient and effective designs. Proximity allows
            for related items to be grouped together, while alignment ensures
            that the elements are visually connected. Repetition creates
            consistency throughout the design, and contrast helps to highlight
            important elements using visual differences. By utilizing these
            principles, designers can create visually appealing designs that
            communicate information effectively. An example of these principles
            being used can be seen in Slack's design, which utilizes grids to
            place items in a well-aligned order. This results in a design that
            is easy to use and visually appealing to users.
